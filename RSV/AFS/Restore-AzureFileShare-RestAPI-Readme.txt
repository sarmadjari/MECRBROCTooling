================================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Restores a backed-up Azure File Share from a Recovery Services Vault using
the Azure Backup REST API. Supports full share and item-level restores to
original or alternate locations.

Restore Types:
  - Full Share Restore — Restores the entire file share.
  - Item Level Restore — Restores specific files or folders.

Important Support Notes : 
1. For AFS Vaulted Policy, Only ALR restore is released in production. ILR and OLR are not released yet.
2. For AFS Vaulted Policy, The Target folder name during Restore has to be empty.
3. For AFS Vaulted Policy, The Copy Options have to be Overwrite only.
4. Check https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/azure-file-share-support-matrix?tabs=vault-tier#supported-restore-methods

Recovery Types:
  - Original Location — Restores to the same storage account and file share.
  - Alternate Location — Restores to a different storage account/file share.

Copy Options:
  - Overwrite — Replaces existing files at the destination.
  - Skip — Keeps existing files, skips conflicts.
  - FailOnConflict — Fails the restore if any file conflicts exist.

Workflow:
  1. Authenticates via Bearer token (Azure PowerShell or CLI).
  2. Verifies the file share is a protected backup item in the vault.
  3. User selects restore type (Full Share or Item Level).
  4. User selects recovery type (Original or Alternate Location).
  5. Collects target location details (for Alternate Location).
  6. Collects item specifications (for Item Level Restore).
  7. User selects conflict resolution policy (Overwrite/Skip/FailOnConflict).
  8. Lists available recovery points and lets user select one.
  9. Constructs the AzureFileShareRestoreRequest body.
  10. Triggers the restore operation and polls for completion.



WHERE TO RUN
------------
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+ (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run from any terminal: PowerShell console, Windows Terminal, VS Code terminal,
  or Azure Cloud Shell.
- The script is interactive (uses Read-Host prompts), so it must be run in a
  foreground terminal session — not as part of an automated pipeline.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
You need ONE of the following for authentication:

  Option A — Azure PowerShell Module (Az)
    Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    Connect-AzAccount

  Option B — Azure CLI
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
    az login

No other modules or packages are required. The script uses only built-in
PowerShell cmdlets (Invoke-RestMethod, Invoke-WebRequest, ConvertTo-Json)
alongside the Azure REST API.

Example 5 — Using Azure CLI for authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  PS> az login
  PS> .\Restore-AzureFileShare-RestAPI.ps1

  If Azure PowerShell (Az module) is not installed, the script
  automatically falls back to Azure CLI for token acquisition.


OUTPUT
------
The script prints color-coded output to the console:
  - Cyan:    Section headers and prompts
  - Yellow:  Warnings, status updates, and operation polling
  - Green:   Success confirmations
  - Gray:    Detail values (IDs, names, recovery point properties)
  - White:   Recovery point listings and item specifications
  - Red:     Errors

Recovery point listing shows for each point:
  - Recovery Point ID, Time, Type, Size (GB)

On success, the script displays:
  - Operation completed successfully
  - Restore Job ID
  - Vault name for portal tracking


ERROR HANDLING
--------------
Common issues and what the script reports:

  - File share not found in vault protection:
      Lists all protected file shares and suggests verification steps.

  - No recovery points found:
      Advises to ensure the file share is backed up with available points.

  - Restore operation fails:
      Shows HTTP status code, error code, and message.

  - Authentication failure:
      Prompts to run Connect-AzAccount or az login.

  - Operation timeout:
      Directs user to check Azure Portal for final status.
